## Summary

- I am the only person that worked on this homework assignment
- I did add the ability to create new flashcards :)
- Note: When you edit a card, you do have to cycle through all of them in order for the change to appear
- SOLVED ~~Issue: I have to view a new card before going to the second view. If after starting the application
I go to the second view -> go to the first view -> view a flashcard & answer -> go to second view, the Q&A from 
the card I just viewed won't show up in the edit text field. So, I'm looking for a function that reloads the Second 
view every time we click into it.~~
