### EtchTest

This is a personal experimental project inspired by a proposed final project. It's meant to operate quite similarly 
to an Etch-a-Sketch toy, with a few exceptions & bonuses.

#### Proposed Features

###### *Important/Urgent*

- [x] Continuous lines by pressing directional buttons 

- [x] Tapping a new point to start a new line segment

- [ ] Shake to erase the screen

###### *Less Urgent*

- [ ] Pen tools: Width, color

- [ ] Save a sketch

- [ ] Share a sketch on social media


#### To-Do List

- [ ] Add alert for case where user hasn't tapped on a starting point, and/or make default center of the screen

- [ ] Gesture Recognizers for long presses on directional buttons

- [ ] Shake to Erase

- [ ] Onboarding screens explaining how to use the app
