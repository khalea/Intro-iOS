### EtchTest

This is a personal experimental project inspired by a proposed final project. It's meant to operate quite similarly 
to an Etch-a-Sketch toy, with the exception of being able to use non-continuous lines.

#### Proposed Features

###### *Important/Urgent*

- [x] Continuous lines by pressing directional buttons 

- [x] Tapping a new point to start a new line segment

- Shake to erase the screen

###### *Less Urgent*

- Pen tools: Width, color

- Save a sketch

- Share a sketch on social media
